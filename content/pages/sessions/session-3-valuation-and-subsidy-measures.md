Determining whether a particular government credit program is in the public interest requires a careful assessment of costs and benefits. A primary focus is the credit subsidy. This session aims to educate participants on the basic finance principles used to assess and forecast this cost. For illustrative purposes, the discussion will be based around an example of how each facet shows up in the planning process of one agency.
